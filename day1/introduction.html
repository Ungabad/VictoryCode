        <p>Hi all, my name is Aaron Dalager, I'm 42 years old. I'm born and raised in the PNW, mainly in the Spokane Washington area. I was home schooled until the age of 13, I taught myself <span>HTML4</span> 
        at the age of 14 and wrote background story for a gaming community between the ages of 14 and 17 on my personal Angelfire website
        that had it been printed would have been around 50 pages long. </p>
        <p>I came to Victory Boot Camp with the intentions to learn all that I can and re-motivate myself to achieve my goals in life and hopefully find a career in the tech industry</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I play a lot of <mark>video games</mark>, and occasionally steam my gaming on Twitch.tv under the gamertag <mark>Ungabad</mark>. Ungabad is my Gamertag over multiple platforms and numerous
        games. The gamertag is a play on the Gundabad orcs in JRR Tolkien's literary world of Middle Earth.
