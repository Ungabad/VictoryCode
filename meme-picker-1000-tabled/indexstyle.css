/* in this exercise we will be using variables, responsive images, scalar measurements, and progress indicators */
/*Lets cover the scalar measurement first, for this we will have an input form that users will input a number between 1 and 10, based on that value we will show an image of the percentage of something
    that will be funny or quirky these images will be responsive in some manner and we will use variables throughout the css, and provide a progression indicator for something else.*/
